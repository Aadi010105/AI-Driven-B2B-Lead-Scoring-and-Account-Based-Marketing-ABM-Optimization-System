# AI-Driven-B2B-Lead-Scoring-and-Account-Based-Marketing-ABM-Optimization-System


This repository hosts the development of an AI-driven Lead Scoring and Account-Based Marketing (ABM) Recommendation System aimed at enhancing B2B marketing strategies. By utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, the system is designed to predict lead conversion probabilities, assign scores to leads based on their conversion potential, and deliver personalized, actionable recommendations to refine marketing approaches. This solution empowers businesses to prioritize high-value leads, optimize marketing efforts, and drive more effective decision-making in their campaigns. 

The project is being undertaken as part of the INFOSYS Springboard Internship Program and is currently in progress.
